%{\bf \sc Research Summary} 
%{\bf Measuring $W$-helicity fractions at 8 TeV in semileptonic top quark pair decays}\\
%I was one of two analyzers on the 8 TeV measurement of the $W$ boson helicity fractions in semileptonic $t\bar{t}$ decays. My contributions included the analysis of the hadronic $W$ decays, the kinematic fitting procedure used to reconstruct the $t\bar{t}$ system, and the template fitting procedure used to extract the helicity fractions from the final observables. This work produced the most sensitive $W$ helicity fraction result from ATLAS and was the first analysis to directly measure helicity angles using the hadronic $W$ in $t\bar{t}$ decays. The analysis has been been published in the European Physical Journal C (EPJC). 

%{\bf Search for exotic di-higgs production at 13 TeV using the $b\bar{b}WW^*$ final state}\\
%I am one of five analyzers working on a Run 2 search for exotic di-higgs production in the semileptonic $b\bar{b}WW^*$ final state. This is the first search ever attempted in this channel. Using the knowledge and techniques gained from my experience with $t\bar{t}$, I am responsible for developing the data-driven methods to estimate multi-jet background contributions, using kinematic fitting techniques to reduce contributions coming from $t\bar{t}$, and developing and implementing the statistical analysis used to set final limits on exotic di-higgs production. The analysis is nearing completion and is aiming to have public results for by Summer 2017.

%\newpage

%{\bf Measuring vector boson scattering in the $V\gamma$ final state}\\
%I worked as one of the analyzers on the 8 TeV measurement of vector boson scattering in the $V\gamma$ final state. I contributed to the intial sensitivity studies, optimization of the event selection, and a data-driven estimation of the $V$+jets contributions in the various signal and control regions. The analysis has been published in the Journal of High Energy Physics (JHEP).

%{\bf Measurement of the Higgs boson decay into $Z\gamma$}\\
%I contributed to the Run I analysis searching for Higgs boson decays in the $Z\gamma$ channel. I worked on estimating and modelling the inteference between Higgs and other Standard Model production in the $\ell\ell\gamma$ final state.

%{\bf DCS Interface for the ATLAS Diamond Beam Monitor }\\ 
%I developed the software interface for control and monitoring of the ATLAS Diamond Beam Monitor (DBM) using the WinCC language platform. I also aided in the installation of the DBM and tests of the detector's proper configuration and operation.

%{\bf Trigger and shift leader shifts in the ATLAS Control Room} \\ 
%I have taken both trigger and shift leader shifts as part of the Run II operation of the ATLAS detector.
