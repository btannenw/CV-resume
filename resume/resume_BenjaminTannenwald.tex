{\large {\bf Graduate Research Associate}\hfill Columbus, OH/Geneva, CH\vspace{1mm}}\\
{\large \it Ohio State University/CERN \hfill  2013 - 2017} \\
\vspace{-6mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5mm]
\item Produced precise measurements of the interactions of fundamental particles and searched for new signatures of the Higgs boson with petabyte scale datasets collected at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
\item Designed distributed computing algorithms to sift through terabytes of physics data, categorize events based on significant criteria, and optimize reconstruction of subatomic interactions using combinatorical likelihoods 
\item Created data-driven methods for modeling background processes in searches for novel experimental signatures 
\item Modeled uncertainty in complex multivariate processes using various statistical techniques in order to understand significance of observed results
\item Developed C++ software frameworks used by physicists at 6 collaborating international and American institutions
\item Used industrial machinery control software to design and commission user interfaces for experimental devices
\begin{itemize}
\item Tested and installed sensitive silicon and diamond-based pixel detectors
\item Used WinCC to create data structures and interface for efficient detector monitoring and operation
\end{itemize}
\item Developed and maintained Condor computing cluster used for simulation and data analysis
\item Worked in small (2-4 people) and larger (10-20 people) analysis groups spread across multiple time zones in supporting and leadership roles coordinating workflow and collaborating on multiple projects
\item Presented analysis work and results to research groups inside the collaboration and to larger audiences at international scientific conferences
\end{itemize}
