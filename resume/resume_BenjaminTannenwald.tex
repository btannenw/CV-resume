{\large {\bf Graduate Research Associate}\hfill Columbus, OH/Geneva, CH\vspace{1mm}}\\
{\large \it Ohio State University/CERN \hfill  2013 - 2017} \\
\vspace{-6mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5mm]
\item Worked in large data analysis collaboration to perform precise measurements of fundamental particles and search for new signatures of the Higgs boson with petabyte scale datasets collected at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
\item Developed C++ software frameworks used by physicists at 5 other international and American institutions
\item Designed distributed computing algorithms to sift through terabytes of physics data, categorize events based on significant criteria, and optimize reconstruction of subatomic interactions using combinatorical likelihoods 
\item Created data-driven methods for modeling background processes in searches for novel experimental signatures 
\item Experience with statistical techniques used to model complex multivariate processes and calculate significance of observed results
\item Worked extensively with industrial control software, designing and commissioning user interfaces for experimental devices
\begin{itemize}
\item Tested and installed sensitive silicon and diamond-based pixel detectors
\item Used WinCC to create data structures and interface for efficient detector monitoring and operation
\end{itemize}\vspace{2mm}
\item Presented analysis work and results to research groups inside the collaboration and to larger audiences at international scientific conferences\vspace{2mm}
\item Developed and maintained Condor computing cluster used for simulation and data analysis
